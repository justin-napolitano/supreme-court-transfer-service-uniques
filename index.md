# PostgreSQL to Neo4j Transfer: Unique Nodes and DB Optimization

## Motivation

When migrating data from a normalized relational database like PostgreSQL to a graph database such as Neo4j, the primary challenge is to preserve data integrity and uniqueness. Graph databases excel at representing complex relationships, but duplicate nodes can distort query results and degrade performance. This project addresses how to maintain unique nodes and optimize relationships during such a transfer, specifically for Supreme Court case metadata.

## Problem Statement

Relational databases store data in multiple normalized tables, linked by foreign keys. When importing this data into Neo4j, each entity must be represented by a single unique node. Without enforcing uniqueness, the graph can contain redundant nodes representing the same entity, which complicates queries and analysis.

The source PostgreSQL database includes tables such as:

- `items`: Supreme Court case metadata
- `callnumbers`: Call numbers associated with cases
- `contributors`: Contributors to cases
- `resources`: PDFs, images, and other resources
- `subjects`: Subjects related to cases

Each table references others via foreign keys, ensuring normalized and unique data in the relational model.

## Approach

The transfer process leverages the normalized structure of the PostgreSQL database to create unique nodes in Neo4j. This involves:

1. **Identifying Unique Entities:** Using primary keys and unique constraints from PostgreSQL to define uniqueness in Neo4j nodes.

2. **Creating Nodes with Uniqueness Constraints:** Using Neo4j's constraints or MERGE operations to ensure no duplicate nodes are created.

3. **Establishing Relationships:** Mapping foreign key relationships to graph relationships, preserving the normalized structure.

4. **Optimizing Queries:** By maintaining uniqueness and normalized relationships, queries on the Neo4j graph become more efficient and accurate.

## Implementation Details

- The process is implemented in Java, as indicated by project tags.
- Data transfer scripts or code likely use Neo4j's Java driver and PostgreSQL JDBC to connect and transfer data.
- The use of `MERGE` in Cypher queries ensures nodes are created only if they do not exist.
- Relationships are created after nodes are established to maintain referential integrity.

## Practical Considerations

- Ensuring indexes and constraints in Neo4j before data import improves performance.
- Batch processing large datasets prevents memory issues.
- Logging and error handling during transfer are critical for troubleshooting.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a practical approach to migrating normalized relational data into a graph database while preserving node uniqueness and relationship integrity. By leveraging the structure of the source database and Neo4j's capabilities, it produces an optimized graph representation suitable for complex queries and analysis.
